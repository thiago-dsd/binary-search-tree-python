# Binary Search Tree in Python

This project is a Python implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** that stores people data (name and age) and supports multiple tree traversal methods.

## 🚀 Features

- Binary Search Tree structure  
- Insertion based on:
  - Primary key: **age**
  - Secondary key: **name** (used when ages are equal)
- Tree traversals:
  - Inorder
  - Preorder
  - Postorder
  - Reverse Inorder (Descending Order)
  - Breadth-First Search (Level Order)
- Console output displaying **name and age**

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
binary-search-tree-python/
├── main.py # Program execution and tree population
├── bst.py # Binary Search Tree implementation
└── node.py # Node (Person) definition
```

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-search-tree-python.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd binary-search-tree-python
```


3. Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧠 Example Output

The program prints the tree using the following traversal methods:

- Inorder
- Preorder
- Postorder
- Reverse Inorder (Descending)
- Breadth-First (Level Order)

Each output displays the **name and age** of each person stored in the tree.
